We've split our project into two groups, one working on training the AI for gesture recognition and one to configure the output given to us by the AI into a usable form on a windows device.

For the output configuration, we've identified a python library that will allow us to manipulate keypresses and mouse movement
https://pypi.org/project/pynput/
We will be using python for this implementation because it will integrate more easily with the AI, which is also in python.
We also plan to have a simple game or demonstration which these inputs will be used on.

Setbacks and challenges:
We have had progress working with lambda labs and figuring out how it will function with our project, but the process has been complex
Mid-terms have presented a significant obstacle as far as time management goes for our team to coordinate, but this should rectify itself as exams finish up.
